## About
A colleague commented that he could add multiple clocks in Windows by default but not in mac. I thought it sounded interesting and a quick app store search showed a few applications already doing this. However as I am in the process of learning swift and wanted to try my hand at a macOS application I decided to roll my own as a learning exercise. This is the (slightly unpolished) result.
